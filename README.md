# three-catmull-rom-path-animation
Three.js demo using a Catmull-Rom path to translate a treadmill animation to a given target.

## Progress Report
In addition to the path, the direction (tangent to the point along the curve) is needed to animate a character so that it rotates on its Y-axis as it walks along the curved. To test, arrows are placed over each rendered point along the curve. While the tangent slopes are working, the direction is not (the arrows flip from going toward the click point to away). Further tests are needed.
